## Contributions

All contributions are welcome! We are actively looking for more developers.

### Pre-Commit Tasks

- ~~Test all features before committing to the `gitmaster` branch.~~ We like breaking changes (literally breaking) on prod.
- Lint and compile code. Edit code if needed. Repeat until no errors are returned.
- Commit and push.
